</h1>
<p>Have you ever been asked WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? I was once asked this in a high-stakes job interview and my answer was that of a startled rabbit caught in the headlights before becoming roadkill. Nobody has asked me that question before or since. It‚Äôs a question that triggered even more questions in my head rather than a coherent answer from my mouth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why was the interviewer asking, when the school was listed right at the top of my CV?</li>
<li>How is the school I attended relevant to my suitability for a given job?</li>
<li>Was this a friendly warm-up question, an innocent icebreaker or an inappropriately tricky tiebreaker?</li>
<li>Was the purpose of the interview to enable the Human Resources department to tick some box for #Equality, #Diversity &amp; #Inclusion before abandonding me by the roadside as deliberate interview roadkill?</li>
<li>Maybe the interviewer would like to know where they could shove their stupid questions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Years later, I still can‚Äôt decide what to make of the WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO interview question. If you were asked this question in a high-stakes job interview what would your answer be?</p>
<p>This is my answer featuring the University of Oxford, the Social Mobility Commission, the Sutton Trust, Martina Milburn, Peter Lampl, Justine Greening, the Independent Schools council, Catrin Nye, Bryan Mathers from Visual Thinkery, The Royal Society, the Royal Family and a club I‚Äôve recently joined as a founding member, called the 93 percent club.</p>
<p>Thanks to sophie pender, imogen carr, Lorna Culpin, ellie waldrope, viktor polyakov, st laurence school academy trust, nice to meet you sarah mohamed, conor churchman, benjamin hobbs</p>
<p>To my #EDI, #WideningParticipation and #SocialResponsibility colleagues at the University of Manchester you might find this interesting: sheeree palmer, banji adewumi, julian skyrme, andrew stewart, uli sattler and paul nutter</p>

</h2>
<p>The heavily loaded question WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO is a very personal, political and provocative one. It proved to be a fatal question in my PhD<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Its actually called a DPhil in Oxford but since most people call it a PhD, we‚Äôll stick with that&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> interview at the University of Oxford because it was totally unexpected and I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the snarky reply to my bewildered answer. As with many job interviews, there was a big power imbalance between the interviewer and the interviewee. The Professor interviewing me was a member of numerous exclusive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_boy_network">old boy networks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen%27s_club">gentlemen‚Äôs clubs</a><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Royal Society admit women now, but only relatively recently. Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson were the first female fellows of the Royal Society in 1945. As of 2024, only &lt;code&gt;12%&lt;/code&gt; of Royal Society Fellows are women &lt;a href="https://royalsociety.org/current-topics/diversity/"&gt;royalsociety.org/current-topics/diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> of London town including the UK‚Äôs National Academy of Sciences, known as the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/">royalsociety.org</a>. Members, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society">Fellows (as they like to be called)</a>, get to use the prestigious letters <code>FRS</code> after their name. The Professor was also appointed a <a href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/awards-and-accreditation/content/103372">Commander of the British Empire</a> by the royal family. Members of this exclusive imperial and royalist club get to use the letters <code>CBE</code> after their name.</p>

<p>The odds are about <code>5:1</code> that this Professor was also a member of the <code>7%</code> club, the elite minority group of the UK population who are <a href="https://www.isc.co.uk">privately educated</a> by one of our formidable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Privilege">Engines of Privilege</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nicebutdim">Green and Kynaston 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-mostpowerful">Lampl and Milburn 2019</a>)</span> But who knows? This Professor was a definitely proud to be a member of the <code>0.002%</code> club, the Royal Society<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;There are about ~8000 Fellows of the Royal Society. 80% of them are dead. That might sound grim but they have been going for 350+ years and only invite around 60 carefully selected new fellows to join their elite club each year. Former Fellows include Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing etc, and yes the jolly good Fellows of the Royal Society are overwhelmingly male and pale, although they‚Äôre not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; stale. There‚Äôs about ~1600 living fellows and about ~70 million inhabitants on the UK, so 1600 / 70,000,000 ‚âÖ 0.002%. Its a bit more complicated than that because there are foreign members too, but this is a back-of-the-envelope approximation&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> and the <code>0.001%</code> club, what‚Äôs left of the British Empire<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the King awards 100 new CBE‚Äôs every year and there are around 600,000 people born each year in the UK, so let‚Äôs say 100/60,0000 ‚âÖ 0.001%&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a>. His pride was justified because membership of those clubs doesn‚Äôt come easily. The Professor was up there in career heaven with other Gods, who also had lots of titles and letters after their names too.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to my interviewer, the only letters I had after my name was a humble <code>BSc</code> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree">Hons</a>). On being asked WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO, these letters were rapidly followed by a collection of other post-nominal letters including <code>WTF</code>? <code>OMG</code> and <code>FFS</code>! The only club I was a member of was the <code>93%</code> club, a group for the overwhelming majority of the UK population educated in state schools. The club didn‚Äôt actually exist back then but I‚Äôm glad it exists now.</p>
<p>While I ended up as yet more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill">roadkill</a> (see figure <a href="#fig:rabbit-fig">1</a>) on the interview <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_to_Hell_(song)">highway to hell</a>, just another casualty of the <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100026561">Oxford juggernaut</a>, I learned a painful but important lesson about the value of what the <code>93%</code> clubbers call State School Pride. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-93bbc">Nye 2021</a>)</span></p>
<p>Education is paradoxical, it‚Äôs both <em>incredibly relevant</em> and <em>completely irrelevant</em> in job interviews. My state schooling, funded by the taxpayer, was the reason I‚Äôd been invited to interview because my teachers had done a good job. If it wasn‚Äôt for the teachers who patiently taught me (and all my friends) during thirteen years of primary and secondary school education I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to express myself to craft a CV and persuasive covering letter to convince decision makers to interview me. If it wasn‚Äôt for my maths and science teachers, I would never have made it to University in the first place.</p>
<p>But at the same time, that very same education should not affect how I was treated, it should not have been an interview question because it was simultaneously irrelevant and relevant. The school I went to shouldn‚Äôt be a factor in either being invited to interview or being made a job offer. With help from Viktor Polyakov and Ellie Wardrope, I recorded a video testimonial to that effect last week in the pop-up studio at the 93percent.club.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Pender">Sophie Pender</a>, <a href="https://www.93percent.club/team">Imogen Carr</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorna-culpin-a5787879">Lorna Culpin</a> for inviting me to (and hosting) the Founding Member‚Äôs Reception at <a href="https://www.ey.com">ey.com</a> in Manchester.

<p>The time has come to do what every teacher tells their students to do, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">Read The Friendly Manual</a> (or question) <code>RFTM</code> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATFQ">Answer The Friendly Question</a> <code>ATFQ</code>.</p>
<p>So what school did I go to? WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? I don‚Äôt really care and its not really any of my business anyway. There‚Äôs an argument for making your education another <a href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights">legally protected characteristic</a> because it shouldn‚Äôt be a factor in how you are treated. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-amolceiling">Rajan, Hix, and Radford 2022</a>)</span> Just like your age, your race, your religion, your sexual orientation, your gender, your disabilities, your marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity shouldn‚Äôt determine how you are treated either. Your education is your business, and you probably didn‚Äôt have that much say in which school you went to anyway.</p>
<p>What I defintely care about <code>100%</code>, is the school I went to, especially when someone asks me in a high-stakes job interview then mocks my reply. I‚Äôm lucky to have attended the kind of state school that never held me back and got me to wherever I wanted to go to. Thank you <a href="https://www.fitzmauriceschool.info/">Fitzmaurice Primary School</a> and <a href="https://www.st-laurence.com/">St.¬†Laurence School</a>.

<p>Not everyone educated in the state sector is as fortunate as me and my school friends from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country">West Country</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-amolceiling">Rajan, Hix, and Radford 2022</a>)</span> As the Education secretary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Greening">Justine Greening</a> once put it, talent is spread evenly but opportunity is not. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-greening">Greening 2017</a>)</span> There is a <a href="https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/trade/the-class-ceiling">class ceiling</a> which prevents too many students educated in the state sector from getting the opportunities they need and deserve. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-classceiling">Friedman and Laurison 2020</a>)</span> That‚Äôs just plain wrong. Unfortunately, the UK is still a country where the school you went to <em>definitely</em> counts, and the higher you go in any profession, the more it matters. Your education has a huge influence on how society treats you and our educational system is riddled with inequality.
