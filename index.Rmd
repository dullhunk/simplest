# SO, WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? {-}

Have you ever been asked WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? I was once asked this in a high-stakes job interview and my answer was that of a startled rabbit caught in the headlights before becoming roadkill. Nobody has asked me that question before or since. It's a *big question* that triggered even more questions in my head rather than a coherent answer from my mouth:

* Why was the interviewer asking, when the school was listed right at the top of my CV? 
* How is the school I attended relevant to my suitability for the job?
* Was this a friendly warm-up question, an innocent icebreaker or an inappropriately tricky tiebreaker?
*  Was the purpose of the interview to enable the Human Resources department to tick some box for #Equality, #Diversity & #Inclusion before abandonding me by the roadside as deliberate interview roadkill?
* Maybe the interviewer would like to know where they could shove their stupid questions?

Years later, I still can't decide what to make of the WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO interview question. If you were asked this *big question* in a high-stakes job interview what would your answer be?

This is my answer featuring the University of Oxford, the Social Mobility Commission, the Sutton Trust, Martina Milburn, Peter Lampl, Justine Greening, the Independent Schools council, Catrin Nye, Bryan Mathers from Visual Thinkery, The Royal Society, the Royal Family and a club I've recently joined as a founding member, called the 93 percent club.

## Beware of the heavily loaded juggernaut! {-}

The heavily loaded *big question* WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO is a very personal, political and provocative one. It proved to be a fatal one in my PhD^[Its actually called a DPhil in Oxford but since most people call it a PhD, we'll stick with that] interview at the University of Oxford because it was totally unexpected and I wasn't prepared for the snarky reply to my bewildered answer. As with many job interviews, there was a big power imbalance between the interviewer and the interviewee. The Professor interviewing me was a member of the oldest of [old boy networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_boy_network) and most exclusive [gentlemen's clubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen%27s_club)^[Yes, the Royal Society admit women now, but only relatively recently for an organisation that started in 1660. Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson were the first female fellows of the Royal Society in 1945. As of 2024, only `12%` of Royal Society Fellows are women [royalsociety.org/current-topics/diversity](https://royalsociety.org/current-topics/diversity/)] of London town including the UK's National Academy of Sciences, confusingly known as the [royalsociety.org](https://royalsociety.org/). Members, or [Fellows (as they like to be called)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society), get to use the prestigious letters `FRS` after their name. The Professor was also a [Commander of the British Empire](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/awards-and-accreditation/content/103372) appointed by the royal family. Members of this imperial British club for royalists get to use the letters `CBE` after their name.

(ref:captionrabbit) Just before becoming interview roadkill, I froze like a breathless rabbit caught in the headlights of the *big question* many state schoolers dread: WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? [@varsity] Do not pass GO, do not ascend the _Stairway to Heaven_, [@stairway] this is more of a _Highway to Hell_. [@highwaytohell] Rabbit sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) üê∞

The odds are about `5:1` that this Professor was also a member of the `7%` club, the elite minority group of the UK population who are [privately educated](https://www.isc.co.uk) by one of our formidable [Engines of Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Privilege). [@nicebutdim;@mostpowerful] But who knows? This Professor was a definitely proud to be a member of the `0.002%` club, the Royal Society^[There are ~8,000 Fellows of the Royal Society. 80% of them are dead. ‚ò†Ô∏è That might sound grim but their club has been going for 350+ years and they only invite ~60 painstakingly selected new fellows to join their elite club each year. Former Fellows include Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing etc, and yes the jolly good Fellows of the Royal Society are overwhelmingly male and pale, although they're not _all_ stale. There's about ~1,600 living fellows and about ~70 million inhabitants on the UK, so 1600 / 70,000,000 ‚âÖ 0.002%. Its a bit more complicated than that because there are foreign members too, but this is a back-of-the-envelope approximation] and the `0.001%` club, what's left of the British Empire^[In the UK, the King awards 100 new CBE's every year and there are around 600,000 people born each year in the UK, so let's say 100/60,0000 ‚âÖ 0.001%]. His pride was justified because membership of those clubs doesn't come easily. The Professor was up there in career heaven with other Gods, who also had lots of titles and letters after their names too. 

## Stairway to Heaven or Highway to Hell? {-}

In stark contrast to my interviewer, the only letters I had after my name were the humble `BSc` ([Hons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree)). On being asked *the big question* WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO, these letters were rapidly followed by a collection of other post-nominals including `WTF`? `OMG` and `FFS`! The only club I was a member of was the inclusive `93%` club, a group for the overwhelming majority of the UK population educated in state schools. The club didn't actually exist back then but I'm glad it exists now. 

While I ended up as yet more [roadkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill) (see figure \@ref(fig:rabbit-fig)) on the interview [highway to hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_to_Hell_(song)), just another casualty of the [Oxford juggernaut](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100026561), I learned a painful but important lesson about the value of what the `93%` clubbers call State School Pride. [@93bbc]

Education is paradoxical, it's both _incredibly relevant_ and _completely irrelevant_ in job interviews. My state schooling, funded by the taxpayer, was the reason I'd been invited to interview because my teachers had done a good job. If it wasn't for the teachers who patiently taught me (and my friends and family) during thirteen years of primary and secondary school education I wouldn't have been able to  express myself to craft a CV and persuasive covering letter to convince decision makers to interview me. If it wasn't for my maths and science teachers, I would never have made it to University in the first place. 

But at the same time, that very same education should not affect how I was treated, it should not have been an interview question because it was simultaneously irrelevant and relevant. The school I went to shouldn't be a factor in either being invited to interview or being made a job offer. With help from Viktor Polyakov and Ellie Wardrope, I recorded a video testimonial to that effect last week in the pop-up studio at the 93percent.club. 

Thanks to [Sophie Pender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Pender), [Imogen Carr](https://www.93percent.club/team) and [Lorna Culpin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorna-culpin-a5787879) for inviting me to (and hosting) the Founding Member's Reception at [ey.com](https://www.ey.com) in Manchester. I had a blast, it was good to speak to you [Conor Churchman](https://www.ada.ac.uk/page/?title=People&pid=63&people=259) from [ada.ac.uk](https://www.ada.ac.uk/), the National College for Digital Skills, [Sarah Mohammed Qureshi](https://www.law.ac.uk/resources/blog/diversity-matters-sarah-mohammad-qureshi/) from the University of Law and [Benjamin Hobbs](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/benjamindhobbs) from the [Greater Manchester Combined Authority](https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/).

## Answer The Friendly Question (AFTQ) {-}
So I need to do what I and many other teachers repeatedly tell their students to do: [Read The Friendly Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) (or question) `RFTM` and [Answer The Friendly Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATFQ) `ATFQ`.

WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? I don't really care and its not really any of my business anyway. There's an argument for making your education another [legally protected characteristic](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights) because it shouldn't be a factor in how you are treated. [@amolceiling] Just like your age, your race, your religion, your sexual orientation, your gender, your disabilities, your marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, your education shouldn't determine how you are treated either. Your education is your business, and you probably didn't have that much say in which school you went to anyway.

What I defintely care about `100%`, is the school I went to, especially when someone asks me in a high-stakes job interview then mocks my reply. I'm lucky to have attended the kind of state school that never held me back and got me to wherever I wanted to go. Thank you [Fitzmaurice Primary School](https://www.fitzmauriceschool.info/) and [St. Laurence School](https://www.st-laurence.com/). Thanks to my amazing state school teachers and thousands more professionals just like them working in a [increasingly challenging sector](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-teacher-shortage-flexibility-and-career-breaks-could-help) to educate *everyone*: 

* regardless of their socio-economic background
* regardless of their ability to win scholarships
* regardless of their ability to pass an extrance exam 
* regardless of their parents ability to pay the school fees


That's [millions of students in state schools across the UK](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-pupils-and-their-characteristics). I'm proud to be a card-carrying, badge-wearing, word-spreading and founding member of the UK's _least_ exclusive members club: the [93percent.club](https://www.93percent.club/). üí™

## Join us in tackling inequality across the UK {-}

Not everyone educated in the state sector is as fortunate as me, my school friends and my family from the [West Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country). [@amolceiling] As the Education secretary [Justine Greening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Greening) once put it, talent is spread evenly but opportunity is not. [@greening] There is a [class ceiling](https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/trade/the-class-ceiling) which prevents many students educated in the state sector from getting the opportunities they need and deserve. [@classceiling] That's just plain wrong. Unfortunately, the UK is still a country where the school you went to _definitely_ counts, and the higher you go in any profession, the more it matters. Your education has a huge influence on how society treats you and our educational system is riddled with inequality. The [Elitist Britain](https://www.suttontrust.com/our-research/elitist-britain-2019/) report by [Martina Milburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Milburn) and [Peter Lampl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lampl) at the Social Mobility Commission and Sutton Trust provides all the evidence you need. [@elitistbritain]

Would you like to help us tackle inequality through the power of community? Would you like empower state-educated students by giving them access to more social capital, better opportunities, improved careers advice and meaningful mentoring? By bringing together thousands of like-minded individuals across the country, we are breaking down the structural barriers to social mobility and building a future that‚Äôs fairer for the next generation.

P.S. Sophie, speaking of word-spreading, when is the next episode of the [WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO](https://open.spotify.com/show/3e8K1fcNbqck9k9pFIGlG8) podcast due? It's been a while... [@whatschooldidyougoto]
